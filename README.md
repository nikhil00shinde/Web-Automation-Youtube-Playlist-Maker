## Youtube Playist Maker

* In this project, I have created Youtube Playlist Maker, in which we have array of songs. Each song will be added in playlist, the name of the playlist will be stored in the *playList* variable.

  * Get the input of email id and password
  * Get the name of the playlist and songs.
  * If you don't want to add any song type *close* in cmd.
  * First, we sign in the Youtube account.
  * Then one by one song will be added in the created playlist
  * then we will go to that playlist and play the song.
